        <p>Snake is a classic arcade game that dates back to the late 1970s. The objective of the game is simple: control a snake as it moves around the screen, gobbling up food and growing longer. However, there's a catch â€“ if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the playing area, it's game over.</p>

        <p> Snake is a straightforward yet captivating game that tests your reflexes, strategic thinking, and precise control. Its addictive nature lies in the quest to achieve the highest score without succumbing to the snake's own body or the walls of the playing area.</p>
