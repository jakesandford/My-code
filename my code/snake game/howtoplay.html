    To play Snake, follow these steps:
    <br>
    1.Set up the game: Start with a designated playing area, usually a grid or rectangular board. Position the snake at a specific location, and scatter some food items randomly across the board.
    <br>
    2.Control the snake: Use the arrow keys or similar controls to guide the snake's movement. It can slither up, down, left, or right, but it can't move diagonally. Once you press an arrow key, the snake starts moving in that direction until you change its course or it reaches a boundary.
    <br>
    3.Eat the food: Your goal is to maneuver the snake towards the food items on the board. As the snake devours the food, it grows longer. Your score increases each time the snake successfully consumes a piece of food.
    <br>
    4.Avoid collisions: Be cautious to prevent the snake from colliding with itself or the walls of the playing area. If the snake's head touches any part of its own body or hits a boundary, the game ends.
    <br>
    5.Increase the challenge: As you progress in the game and the snake becomes longer, it becomes more difficult to navigate without crashing. The speed of the snake may also increase, further adding to the challenge.
    <br>
    6.Keep playing and set high scores: The game continues until the snake collides, allowing you to aim for higher scores and compete with friends to see who can achieve the best results.
